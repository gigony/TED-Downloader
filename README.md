TED Talks Downloader
==============

I found that [TED](http://www.ted.com) talks are useful for learning English because 
TED.COM provides subtitles made by many contributors.

I made a simple python GUI application, *TED Downloader*, using tcl/tk that can easily download videos/audios with subtitles.

Current release is **v2.4.1**(2013-03-24). See the [changelog]



Usage & Development
-------------------

### Configuration

After extracting the zip file, you first need to run **TEDDownloaderConfig.exe** to configure settings.

An error message dialog box will pop up if executable files cannot be run.
In the case, please install [vcredist_x86.exe](http://gigony.tistory.com/attachment/cfile2.uf@147C21264CEC9CDA28F7D8.exe).

- `Encoding` is the encoding of the subtitle text.

  example>
    - English  ==> `ascii` or `utf-8`
    - Korean   ==> `cp949` or `utf-8`
    - Japanese ==> `cp932` or `utf-8`
    
- `Class Name` is a language class for the SMI file (subtitle file).   

- `Language` is an additional language for the subtitle.  

SMI format explanation in detail: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms971327.aspx

`language.txt` is a pre-defined file for the language code.
Each line consists of four different code types of a language
> \[1\) Language name\]    \[2\) langID for TED.com\]    \[3\) iso639 name for SMI\]    \[4\) iso3166 name for SMI\]

The second type is not used because TED.com currently uses 3rd type as a language code

`style.txt` is a style file for the customization of the subtitle (SMI) style.
  

### Download

Run **TEDDownloaderGUI.exe**.
It will take more than 15 seconds to load the list of videos.

After that, select items by using *ctrl*(or *shift*) key + *mouse click* or *mouse dragging*, and click `Download` button.

You can see video/audio files with subtitle files in **VIDEO** folder.

You may clone this repository and run **TEDDownloaderConfig.py** or **TEDDownloaderGUI.py** directly, instead of using released executable files.

Executable files were generated by [py2exe](http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/)\(py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7\)
